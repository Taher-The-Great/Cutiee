        <span>My Dear Alefiyah,</span>
        <br />
        I can't believe it's only been two weeks since we met online, but it feels like we've known each other forever! 💙
        We've shared so much already—our dreams, secrets, and countless laughs ❣️. Even though we haven't met face-to-face yet,
        our bond feels incredibly strong. You’ve become such a special part of my life, and I love how we can talk about anything 
        under the sun ☀️. I’m so grateful for you and excited for all the memories we’ll create together, both online and hopefully
        soon in person 💕. You're truly a gem!🫶🏻
